Platform for publishing and managing affiliate deals of Xiaomi products.

This platform can save products with the description and image among other details. It creates the "sold out" image. And then allows to publish and manage deals of these products, publishing them on Telegram, Twitter and https://oxmf.club/ (https://github.com/marcmc241/oxmf.club-public). You can program the post for a specific date and time, edit or mark it as sold out.

In the settings, you can also modify the deal template for Telegram and Twitter, add product categories, affiliate shops, and more.

This platform is created using basic HTML, CSS and JS, and PHP/MYSQL for the backend. It is the first big platform I created from scratch, without using frameworks. I've also configured the VPS server where this code runs. This platform started in 2016 and was developed during the following years as I advanced in my Multimedia degree and my knowledge.
